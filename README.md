# Proexe task

## How I did

Hey, thank you for checking this. It was hard but super fun. I used redux-toolkit to make things faster, but it ended up being harder I believe. Besides that, I'm pretty happy with how everything went~! Please give me feedback!

I will describe a bit more of the process:

### Stage 1

All good here!

### Stage 2

#### Forms

I tried react-hook-form, which I never used, and ended up making it harder haha. I have to learn to use it correctly with material ui. I ended up using a useForm hook that I found in this link (https://academind.com/tutorials/reactjs-a-custom-useform-hook). I had to modify it heavily though, and this cost me a lot of time. Everything should be working fine :) Oh and I also stole the regex from somewhere, I never understood the syntax, but someday...

#### "Asynchronous" calls

I was able to manage these pretty well, but I'm not sending back status code nor error.

### Stage 3

As I set everything up in Stage 2, this was easier. As I'm reading this I forgot that I didn't hook up the alert component, but its almost time up.

### Stage 4

#### Sorting

I tried but had some questions if it's good to do it in the front end, or in the reducer, as I had trouble sorting the user list and trying to update the state.

## Thank you!

This task was pretty fun and I learnt a lot. I'd like to hear what you think. And of course its not very pretty in organization, because I tried to do it in the time-frame. Hope to hear from you soon!

Have a nice day!
Triana :)
